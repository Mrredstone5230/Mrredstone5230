### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm a French Canadian stuck in High School. I taught myself Java in 2020 (covid yay) and I LOVE IT $!#!@# Most of my projects are Spigot/Bukkit plugins, but I'm nowadays trying to make Fabric mods and Minecraft backend software(private tho). I'm open for requests (contact me on Discord).

In the meantime I do something, feel free to check my profiles:

- curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/members/polishkrowa/projects
- modrinth: https://modrinth.com/user/Mrredstone5230
- discord: PolishKrowa#0001 (Contact me here!)

Other than that, everything is here, enjoy!!
